# Portfolio Website for Author - Kate Brook

This website was created for my girlfriend so that she no longer had to pay for her site that she made with 'wix.com'. This version of the site is hosted on Netlify and can be found at [kate-brook.netlify.app ](https://kate-brook.netlify.app/).

It is a simple, three page, portfolio site using React, React Router, Html and CSS.

I used the making of this site as an opportunity to also utilise 'framer-motion' for the page transitions as well as 'react-responsive-carousel' to display the book covers. It was also an opportunity to create a fully responsive site that fits to different screen sizes and devices. I used a transition for the navbar into a hamburger menu to fit onto mobile devices and flexbox to reposition text and image positions.
