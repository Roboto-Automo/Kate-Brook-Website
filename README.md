# Portfolio Website for Author - Kate Brook

This website was created for my girlfriend so that she no longer needs to pay for the one she made with 'wix.com'. This version of the site is a near identical recreation with some added responsiveness and slightly improved transition animations. The site is hosted on Netlify and can be found at [kate-brook.netlify.app ](https://kate-brook.netlify.app/).

It is a simple, three page, site using React, React Router, Html and CSS as the tech stack.

I used the making of this site as an opportunity to also utilise 'framer-motion' for the page transitions as well as 'react-responsive-carousel' to display the book covers. It was also an opportunity to create a fully responsive site that fits to different screen sizes and devices. I used a transition for the navbar into a hamburger menu to fit onto mobile devices and flexbox to reposition text and image positions.
