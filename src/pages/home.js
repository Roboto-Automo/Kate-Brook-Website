I am an author based in London. My first novel, <Link to="/book"><em>Not Exactly What I Had in Mind,</em></Link> was published in 2022 by Corvus (UK) and Dutton (US), with German and Spanish translations forthcoming. My short-form writing has been published in LitHub, The Fiction Pool and The Real Story. I have a PhD in French Literature and Visual Art from Kingâ€™s College London, and have worked as a bookseller and in publishing.
